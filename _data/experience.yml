    As a Technical Expert at Santander Technology I was leadng a team responsable for designing and implementing CORE services for authentication. Those services are now consumed by the Online Banking Retail site and the Retail Mobile application.
    
    As part of my time as a Leader on the team I help the team not just delivered code but to spread knowledge and our passion for technology, we did run some 30 minutes talks about technology and Cyber security Challenges for our colleagues, our main intention with those initiatives were to share our love for technology and help others to learn.
    
    At that time I was working as a mentor for two colleagues working in different teams, it was a really positive experience that I enjoyed a lot.
